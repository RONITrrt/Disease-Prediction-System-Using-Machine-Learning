## Overview

The Disease Prediction System aims to provide a preliminary risk assessment for three major diseases. This tool is designed for educational purposes, enabling users to understand potential health risks based on their input data.

---

## Features

1. **Diabetes Prediction**
   - Predicts diabetes risk based on parameters like glucose level, BMI, insulin, and age.

2. **Heart Disease Prediction**
   - Evaluates the risk of heart disease using inputs such as cholesterol level, blood pressure, and other medical details.

3. **Parkinson's Disease Prediction**
   - Identifies the likelihood of Parkinson's disease based on voice and medical attributes like jitter and shimmer.
